A Free Code Camp project.

DECEMBER 2020 UPDATE: I've now added Webpack and Babel to this project. I wanted to learn more about how to configure Webpack from scratch, and I also wanted take advantage of what Babel offers to make sure the project supported IE11. I integrated Babel into Webpack's workflow using babel-loader.

JANUARY 2021 UPDATE: I've given the project a redesign with CSS Grid and Flexbox, using Sass as a preprocessor. The colour palette was inspired by colours.cafe (https://www.instagram.com/colours.cafe/).
